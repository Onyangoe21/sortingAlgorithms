# Personal project
# Author: Edwin Omondi Onyango



The **sortingAlgorithms** is responsible for implementing the different sorting algorithms in python.
It details the code and parameter usage.

This design spec will include the following: 

* Inputs and Outputs
* Functional decomposition into modules
* Pseudo code for logic/algorithmic flow
* Dataflow through modules
* Usage instructions
* Testing plan
