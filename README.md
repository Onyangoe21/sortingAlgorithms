# Personal project
# Author: Edwin Omondi Onyango

* This is a quick implementation of the different sorting algorithms.


# Instructions on how to use:
* This document only contains one major class with the different sorting algorithms:
* Read the design.md "usage instructions section" to see what algorithms are included and how to use them and in a nutshell, simply call the classname.(desired sorting algorithm with the right parameters).
