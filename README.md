# Sorting Algorithms for dummies README.md

### I am learning so feel free to correct any mistakes! Thank you!

* This is a quick implementation of the different sorting algorithms. The essence of this repo is to practice the different sorting algorithms with better demonstrations of how the algorithm works(using print statements) and more detailed explanation.

* The other important part of this document is that it gives a more detailed calculation of the runtime complexities.

# Instructions on how to use:
* This document only contains one major class with the different sorting algorithms:
* Read the design.md "usage instructions section" to see what algorithms are included and how to use them and in a nutshell, simply call the classname.(desired sorting algorithm with the right parameters).

*Note: there are print statements denoting some important aspects of different algorithms like the many swaps in bubble sort*
